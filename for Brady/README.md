The skin is the same as my [main iMessenger folder](https://github.com/Azdaema/AO3-Skin_Messaging/tree/master/iMessenger), but with the features you won't need cut out. Just wanted to make it shorter and easier to understand.

If you ever _do_ need some of those features (say, they have a group chat with Tyrion that is exclusively used for complaining about Tywin?) just let me know.
