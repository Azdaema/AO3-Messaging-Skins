First, `ios` is the wrapper class. The whole skin is set to only effect things in the wrapper class, so you could also use it in a fic which was mostly paragraphs of prose but had one text conversion.

```css
<div class="ios">
	<p class="time"><b>Jan 1</b>, 3:27 AM</p>
	<div class="in"><p>I love sening you tinight.</p></div>
	<div class="out"><p>Jaime you're drunk. Go to sleep.</p></div>
	<div class="in"><p>I'm nit drink yiure drunk</p></div>
	<div class="out"><p>right. I'm going to bed. Best of luck in the morning. Drink some water. Xx</p></div>
	<div class="in">
		<p>I kive yu</p>
		<p>kivr</p>
		<p>kove</p>
		<p>fucj. I love yiy</p>
	</div>
</div>
```
