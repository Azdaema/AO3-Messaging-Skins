# `ios`
First, `ios` is the wrapper class. The whole skin is set up to only effect things _inside the wrapper_. So you could also use this skin for which was mostly paragraph of prose, but had one text conversion.

```html
<div class="ios">
	<div class="in">
		<p>incoming text</p>
	</div>
	<div class="out">
		<p>outgoing text</p>
	</div>
</div>
```

# `in` and `out`
`in` and `out` are for incoming and outgoing texts respectively. Texts within the same one will be grouped together, treated like they were sent in rapid succession. You can use two of the same in a row to show that someone waited a minute, with no reply, before texting again.

```html
<div class="ios">
	<div class="in">
		<p>are you there yet?</p>
		<p>Where are you?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="in">
		<p>hello?? seriously where are you???</p>
	</div>
</div>
```

# `pic`
`pic` can be used for 2 different things:
1. Sending photos
2. That up to 3 big emojis thing
```html
<div class="ios">
	<div class="in">
		<p class="pic"><img src="https://picture_image_link.jpg" /></p>
	</div>
	<div class="out">
		<p class="pic">ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–</p>
	</div>
</div>
```

# `time`
`time` is for times. On my phone, for texts older than one week, iOS does it in the format of:
> **[3-letter day of the week abrv], [3-letter month abrv] [day of the month]**, [time] [AM/PM]

So for example:
> **Sun, Jan 19**, 5:20 PM

And it gives the full thing every time. But to make it more readable, if you want to keep it giving the day for the first text of the day, and only the time for subsequent ones, that would be a fair stylistic choice.

```html
<div class="ios">
	<p class="time"><b>Jan 1</b>, 3:27 AM</p>
	<div class="in">
		<p>I love sening you tinight.</p>
	</div>
</div>
```
