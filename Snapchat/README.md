# Wrapper
Wrap your whole texting section in this:
```html
<dl class="snapchat">

</dl>
```

# Features
### Contact header
`<h1>` and `<h2>` are good for this.
```html
<h1 class="contact">Momo</h1>
```

### Day
`<h4>` and `<h5>` are good for this.
```html
<h4 class="day">Febuary 6th</h4>
```

### [Snapchat icons](https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/friends-screen-icon-guide)
* Red is the default. Purple and blue need to be specified.
* The `opened` and `unopened` ones are either a square or an arrow, based on if it's in `in` or `out`.
* The itatics sandwiched in the middle is the hidden backup, for when the skin is turned off.

```html
<dd><span class="icon opened"><i>Snap (without audio) sent and opened</i></span></dd>
<dd><span class="icon opened purple"><i>Snap (with audio) sent and opened</i></span></dd>
<dd><span class="icon opened blue"><i>Chat sent and opened</i></span></dd>

<dd><span class="icon unopened"><i>Snap (without audio) sent</i></span></dd>
<dd><span class="icon unopened purple"><i>Snap (with audio) sent</i></span></dd>
<dd><span class="icon unopened blue"><i>Chat sent</i></span></dd>

<dd><span class="icon screenshot"><i>Screenshot taken of Snap (without audio)</i></span></dd>
<dd><span class="icon screenshot purple"><i>Screenshot taken of Snap (with audio)</i></span></dd>
<dd><span class="icon screenshot blue"><i>Screenshot taken of chat</i></span></dd>

<dd><span class="icon replay"><i>Snap (without audio) has been replayed</i></span></dd>
<dd><span class="icon replay purple"><i>Snap (with audio) has been replayed</i></span></dd>
```

If the wrapper is `<dl class="snapchat nonudes">`, if you click on an icon the text changes to `[No actual nudes. Sorry. This is a fanfic.]`

I set it up like this so the feature can be applied selectively. For example, maybe you have one fic which _is_ sexting, and you want to use it _there_, but you've got another fic where they're sending each other pictures of their dogs, and you don't want to use it there.

### Big emojis
```html
<dd class="emoji">ðŸ’–</dd>
```
